💡 ➡️ Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given a string of comma-separated integers representing an array of `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a _single day_ to buy one stock and choosing a _different day in the future_ to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0. You may assume all stock prices to be positive integers or zero.

➡️ Test Cases

Input: 7,1,5,3,6,4
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Input: 7,6,4,3,1
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Input: 1,2
Output: 1

Input: 2,1
Output: 0

Input: 2,1,0,8
Output: 8
