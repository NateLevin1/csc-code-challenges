💡 ➡️ Remainder Without Division

Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns the remainder of the first number divided by the second number. Your program cannot use the remainder, modulus, division, or multiplication built-in operators, nor any similar operators. Only use addition, subtraction, or bit operations.

For an extra challenge, take the number input in binary as two character arrays, and perform the remainder operation without converting into an integer.
