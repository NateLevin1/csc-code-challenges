💡 ➡️ Long Pressed Name

Your friend is typing their name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Print `true` if it is possible that it was your friend's name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed. Print `false` otherwise.

Your input will be given as a single line, with the `name` and `typed` strings separated by a space.

➡️ Test Cases

Input: "alex aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.

Input: name = "saeed ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.

Input: name = "saeed saeed"
Output: true

Input: name = "saeed saeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed"
Output: true
