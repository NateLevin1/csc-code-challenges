Hello Computer Science Club members,

⭐️ We have a meeting today in room 274 during patriot period.
Make sure to go if you can!

Today we have Code Challenge #🍇! The challenge is below in this email if you'd like to try it but can't come to the meeting. Please email me your solution if you do! Otherwise, we will help each other solve the problem during the meeting.

Hope to see you there!
