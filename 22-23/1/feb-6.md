# CSC Challenge for February 6: Simulate a Falling Rock

To complete this challenge, you will need to create a program in any language that performs the task below.

You are writing a program to simulate falling rocks.
Write a function that, given the initial height of the rock, will print out a string containing ascii art of the rock falling.

Use `R` to represent the rock, spaces to represent empty air, and `_` to represent the ground.

You need to show each step of the rock falling, in columns. See the Test Cases below for more information.

It's not necessary to follow the laws of gravity. Any extra whitespace is ignored.

## Test Cases

Given the initial height 4, your program should output:

```
R
 R
  R
   R
____
```

Given the initial height 1, your program should output:

```
R
_
```

# Part 2: Floating Rock

For part 2, reverse the display, so it looks like the rock is floating.

## Test Cases

Given the initial height 4, your program should output:

```
   R
  R
 R
R
____
```
