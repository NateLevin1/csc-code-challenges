Meeting Today, Next Competition & Challenge #22 (1/24)

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hello Computer Science Club members,

⭐️ We have a meeting today in room 274 during patriot period.
Make sure to go if you can!

🚨 Our next competition will be on February 3rd. We've already formed our team of 4 - sorry if you aren't able to join! If you are one of the 4, I'll be reaching out shortly with more details.

Today we have Code Challenge #22! The challenge is below in this email if you'd like to try it but can't come to the meeting. Please email me your solution if you do!

Hope to see you there!
Nate Levin

💡 ➡️ Min Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two strings is the minimum number of "replace" operations needed to change one string into the other. The two strings will always be of the same length.

For example, the Hamming distance between "abc" and "aac" is 1, since we can replace the second character of "abc" with "a" to get "aac".

Given a list of strings, your program should output the minimum Hamming distance between any 2 strings in the list.

For a (much) harder challenge & bonus point: Instead of computing the Hamming Distance, compute the Levenshtein distance. Learn more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance

➡️ Test Cases

Input: ["zzz", "aac", "abc"]
Output: 1

Input: ["abc", "def", "ghi"]
Output: 3

Input: ["abc", "abc", "azz"]
Output: 0
