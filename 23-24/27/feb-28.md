💡 ➡️ Min Meeting Rooms

Given an array of time intervals for meetings (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required to hold all the meetings.

Note: Meeting start and end times are exclusive - a meeting starting at 0 and ending at 10 does not conflict with a meeting starting at 10 and ending at 20.

➡️ Test Cases

Input is a list of lists, where each list contains two integers representing a meeting's start and end time. The input list is _not sorted_.

Input: []
Output: 0

Input: [[0,1]]
Output: 1

Input: [[0,10],[10,20]]
Output: 1

Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2

Input: [[7, 10],[2, 4]]
Output: 1

Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20],[7, 10],[2, 4]]
Output: 3
