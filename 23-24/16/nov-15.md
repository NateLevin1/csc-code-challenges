💡 ➡️ String Permutations

For this week's challenge, you will need to write a program that takes in a string and outputs all possible permutations of that string (all possible ways to arrange the characters in the string).
Print each permutation on a new line. The order that you give the permutations in does not matter, as long as all permutations are outputted.

See the test cases below for some examples of what your program should output.

Hint: Notice how the permutations of a string involve "swapping" characters. Which characters are swapped, and in what order?
