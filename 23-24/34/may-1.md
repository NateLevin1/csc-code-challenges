💡 ➡️ Tangent Lines

Given the positive integer constants a, b, c, and an integer x value, find the slope of the line tangent to the point at the x value on the curve y = ax^b + cx. Your answer should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Your input will be passed to stdin as four integers separated by spaces, and then a single integer x value. Your output should be the slope of the tangent line at that x value.

➡️ Test Cases

Input: 0 0 0 0
Output: 0.00

Input: 1 2 3 4
Output: 10.00

Input: 1 1 1 -1
Output: -1.00
