💡 ➡️ Look-and-say Sequence

You must construct a function that takes in a number, and outputs the next number in the "Look-and-say sequence". To generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

For example:

-   1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
-   11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
-   21 is read off as "one 2, one 1" or 1211.
-   1211 is read off as "one 1, one 2, two 1s" or 111221.
-   111221 is read off as "three 1s, two 2s, one 1" or 312211.
