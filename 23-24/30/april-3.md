💡 ➡️ Word Search

You are given a word and a word search table, as rows and columns of letters. Your task is to output whether or not the given word is present in the word search — if the word is present, output "Yes", otherwise output "No". A word is considered to be present in the word search if its letters appear in order in the word search in a row (left to right) or a column (top to bottom).

Optional extra challenge: Consider a word to also be present if it appears diagonally (top-left to bottom-right) in the word search.

The first line of the input is the word to search for. The next lines represent the word search. You may assume that all input is composed of lowercase letters. Note that the words will always be "in order" - no need to check for the reverse of the word.
