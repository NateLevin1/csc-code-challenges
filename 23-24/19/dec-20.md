💡 ➡️ Skipping Game

You are playing a game with a number of players `n`, sitting in a circle. To play the game, you start with the first player, then count an integer `k` more players clockwise around the circle. The player you land on is out of the game. Continue until there is only one player left, and output the original position of that player.

Your input will be passed to standard input in the following form: `n k`

➡️ Test Cases

Input: "5 2"
Output: 4
