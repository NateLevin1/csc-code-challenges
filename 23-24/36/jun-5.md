Donuts for Last Meeting of the Year!

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hey Computer Science Club members,

⭐️ Today during Patriot Period we will have the last CSC meeting of the year.
🍩 To celebrate this occasion, I'll be bringing munchkins for everyone.

Thanks to all who came to meetings and participated in HSPCs this year! Hope to see you all returning in the fall. I've attached a fun challenge for those who'd like to give it a try.

Hope to see you then!
Nate Levin
