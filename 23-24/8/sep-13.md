💡 ➡️ Snake Simulator

To complete this challenge, you will need to create a program in any language that performs the task below.

You are writing a program to simulate the movement of a snake. Your input will be 1) the length of the snake and 2) an array of commands, each of which will be one of the following:
"up", "down", "left", "right", or "continue".

You must output the final location of the head and tail of the snake (relative to the starting point). You should assume that the head starts at point [0,0].

➡️ Test Cases

Input:
— snakeLength = 1
— commands = ["right", "right", "right"]

Output:
— head = [0, 3]
— tail = [0, 3]

—

Input:
— snakeLength = 3
— commands = ["right", "right", "right"]

Output:
— head = [3, 0]
— tail = [1, 0]

—

Input:
— snakeLength = 1
— commands = ["right", "up", "left", "down", "continue"]

Output:
— head = [0, -1]
— tail = [0, -1]

—

Input:
— snakeLength = 3
— commands = ["right", "up", "left", "down", "continue"]

Output:
— head = [0, -1]
— tail = [0, 1]
