(This challenge is based on a problem from the Virginia Tech 2015 programming contest.)

Problem Intro: You are tasked with writing a program that will determine the winner of a recent election given a list of every vote.

➡️ Input
The input consists of a single test case, which is a list of votes cast. Each line
in the input contains the name of a candidate for whom a vote was cast. A name may consist of multiple words, separated by spaces. Words contain letters or hyphens, but no other punctuation characters. There will be at least 2 votes on the list. The list of votes ends with a single line containing the characters END. This line should not be counted. There can be up to 100,000 valid votes.

➡️ Output
If a candidate obtained a simple or absolute majority of all votes cast (that is, more than any other candidate), output the name of this candidate! If no candidate obtained a simple majority, output: “Runoff!” (don’t forget to include the exclamation mark!)
