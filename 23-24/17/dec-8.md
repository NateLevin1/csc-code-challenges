💡 ➡️ Number Sort (Know Your Library)

In preparation for the programming competition, today's challenge must be completed in Python.
When completing this problem, you must use regex or string functions for parsing. Make sure to write down any code that you use, as you can use any pre-made code during the competition.

Problem: Given a string of characters to standard input, output the numbers contained in it in sorted order. Do _not_ ignore duplicates.

➡️ Test Cases

Input: "Hello 123 World 456"
Output: 123456

Input: "a111b222c333"
Output: 111222333

Input: "0e98gerg4e0er28eg5"
Output: 00245889
