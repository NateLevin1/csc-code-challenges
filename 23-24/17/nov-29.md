Meeting Today & Challenge #17 (11/28)

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hello Computer Science Club members,

⭐️ We have a meeting today in room 274 during patriot period.
Make sure to go if you can!

🚨 Our first competition will be held on December 9th. We currently have 6 participants, which will leave us with two teams for the competition - I’ll reach out to participants this week with the groups and more info.

🚨 IMPORTANT: Next week, we will have a meeting on Friday, December 8th, _not_ on Wednesday the 6th. 

Today we have Code Challenge #17! The challenge is below in this email if you'd like to try it but can't come to the meeting. Please email me your solution if you do!

Hope to see you there!
Nate Levin
