💡 ➡️ Min Topping Spacing

You are given a string representing a brownie. The brownie is represented by a grid of characters, where each character is either a space or an o. The brownie is surrounded by a border of dashes (-) and vertical bars (|).

The `o` characters represent a topping. They are distributed randomly throughout the brownie in your input. Your job is to find the minimum spacing between any two toppings in the brownie. The spacing between two toppings is the Pythagorean distance between them. Output your answer rounded to 3 decimal places.
