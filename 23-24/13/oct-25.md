💡 ➡️ Caesar's Cipher

This problem is from the ACM 2019 programming competition, on page 7: http://acm.cs.virginia.edu/data/2019-contest.pdf

Caesar has discovered an ingenious way to encode his messages. By shifting the value of each letter in his messages, he can make sure that Brutus will never discover his plans! Your job as Caesar’s scribe is to encode Caesar’s messages.

To encode a message, each lowercase character `c` is shifted by `v`, the shifting value, positions in the alphabet to produce the character s. For example, if c = 'r' and v = 4, the shifted value will be s = 't'. All letters in the messages will be lowercase, and overflow past the last letter of the alphabet 'z' cycles through the start of the alphabet. Thus, if c = 'u' and v = 8, s = 'c'.

Given a message and a shifting value, v, what will the encoded
message be?

➡️ Input Format
The first line of the input will be a single integer n ≤ 10, 000. There will be n test cases that follow. Each test case consists of two lines. On the first line will be the shifting value 0 ≤ v ≤ 128, and on the second will be the plain message from Caesar. Each message will consist of only lowercase characters (a-z) and spaces.

➡️ Output Format
For each message, encode it using the provided shifting value and print it out on its own line

➡️ Sample Input
4
2
et tu brute
5
carpe diem
18
ex nihilo nihil fit
100
audere est facere

➡️ Sample Output
gv vw dtwvg
hfwuj injr
wp fazadg fazad xal
wqzana aop bwyana
