Meeting Today & Challenge #18 (12/13)

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Hello Computer Science Club members,

⭐️ We have a meeting today in room 274 during patriot period.
Make sure to go if you can!

🎉 Great job on the competition last weekend! The Brayden-Gabriel-Winner team came in 12th place, and the Murphy-Nate-Grayson team came in 21st place, with both teams solving 3 problems. Our next programming competition will likely be in February.

To start today's meeting, Brayden will go over his solution to problem H from the competition. His code is available here: https://gist.github.com/BlueZeeKing/d3b5bb226256ed27f62f0b2e60ebd607

We will also have code challenge #18! The challenge is below in this email if you'd like to try it but can't come to the meeting. Please email me your solution if you do!

Hope to see you there!
Nate Levin
