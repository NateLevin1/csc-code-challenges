Hello Computer Science Club members,

⭐️ On December 14th (12/14), we will participate in Virginia Tech's High School Programming Contest. Are you interested in joining Yorktown's team for this event? Please reply to this email and include your phone number.

The event starts at 11am and ends at 4pm. Each team will go to one member's house to participate in the contest. The competition will consist of 8-12 questions similar to our weekly challenges, with the goal of answering the most questions in the least time.
